# CustomUI
A full-screen desktop replacement for very specific use-cases.

This program will not be useable without your own personal customizations.

The idea of this program is to run either ontop of your current desktop, such as the Windows desktop, or macOS Finder.  Preferrably, it should run in a Kiosk mode on a heavily customized Linux core, as I am using it as.  Why did I create such a program and not just use something which already exists, or even a full desktop?  Sometimes, you don't want to have a full desktop environment, and want something extremely simple to operate which preferrably does not require any mouse navigation.  This full-screen program only uses various hotkeys on your keyboard to perform a subset of commands, such as the playing of a DVD Title using `mplayer`, or playing some relaxing music before bed, and having a built-in timer automatically suspend the system at a specific time.  I don't know of many other programs which provide these capabilities.  It also has a nice large clock which can easily be glanced at while lying in bed for example, instead of trying to squint to read the time and date.  It also supports a local weather forcast, which is very useful during anyone's normal morning routine.
